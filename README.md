# Hackfinity Project
World's First Prompt Exclusive 24 hours Hackathon for Agentic AI Solution Development

## Digital Catalog Creation & Maintenance Agent
An AI-powered assistant that helps small sellers—farmers, artisans, and kirana store owners—create and maintain high-quality digital product catalogs.  
The system is **voice- and text-enabled**, supports **local languages**, and generates **market-ready product listings** with ease, bridging the gap between rural entrepreneurs and online marketplaces.

## Problem Statement 
Millions of micro-entrepreneurs struggle with digital catalog creation due to:
- Low digital literacy
- Language barriers and lack of descriptive writing experience
- Preference for voice input over typing
- Errors in manual/unstructured data entry
- Neglect in maintaining and updating stock or prices  
This limits their ability to sell online, digitize inventory, and compete in e-commerce platforms.

## Solution

The **Digital Catalog Agent** simplifies catalog creation and inventory management by providing:  
- Voice & text input support in local languages/dialects  
- AI-generated product descriptions (market-ready)  
- Product category mapping aligned to e-commerce standards  
- Auto-translation (local → English/global formats)  
- Simple dashboard for catalog management
